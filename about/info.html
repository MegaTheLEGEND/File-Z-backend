			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>Q: why is my game not loading?</h3>

			<br>
			<h3>Q: Is File-Z Related to MATH.assist?</h3>
			<h3>A: Yea. File-Z is the successor to MATH.assist. File-Z is still getting updated and improved, whereas MATH.assist has mostly been abandoned.</h3>
			<br>
			<h3>Q: Why does the list show some games but they dont exist?</h3>
			<h3>A: This is probably due to the File-Z client not being up to date. Update File-Z.</h3>
